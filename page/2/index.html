<blockquote>
<p>We are the Warriors of the Code. We are dedicated, strong, merry, and in search of glory. Often we find ourselves engaged in such glorious battles. It is in these battles that warriors fall, advances hard fought, and the days long and tiring.  But we are destroyers and carpenters! We hunger for challenges. We thirst for knowledge! Victory and glory is assured for those that follow the elite, the Warriors of the&nbsp;Code!</p>

<p>I first heard of an <span class="caps">AAR</span> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review">After Action Review</a> ) from my wife while she was in the Army. Years later, I joined a team that used the Agile method and became accustomed to sprint retrospectives.  I like the retrospective concept as a method of reviewing the self and the&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>I’ve said before that this journal’s purpose is partially to help me improve and learn. I meet a lot of people that are afraid to voice their thoughts for fear of being wrong and coming off as a fool. I am one such person. But I never feel that people expressing their thoughts, no matter how raw that thought is, that they themselves are fools. It takes strength and courage to put yourself out&nbsp;there.</p>
