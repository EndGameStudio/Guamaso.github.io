<p>I see folks with the ability to turn off their messaging applications and walk&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>I admire that ability/skill. I don’t have it and it’s to my detriment. I think to have a good work-home balance, this ability is a requirement. There are posts about this everywhere from people of all experiences and skill levels. They all say the same thing, when you leave work, you <em>leave</em> work. Furthermore, you should feel bad about doing&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>This problem is exacerbated by work-from-home-rs, but it doesn’t mean it’s not possible.  It comes down to managing distractions and task list, I think. But I’m sure there’s more to it… otherwise I would have time for my other hobbies!  Obviously, discipline is a huge&nbsp;factor.</p>
<p>Anyway, some weeks are good, some are bad. The past few weeks have been pretty busy. But I’m expecting that it will simmer down in June. I’m personally ok with spurts like this, a busy-ish month in the middle of consistent&nbsp;months. </p>
<p>Still, for the most part, I don’t “clock out” at five like the wife would&nbsp;like.</p>
