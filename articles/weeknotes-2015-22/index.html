<h2 id="retro-lists">Retro&nbsp;Lists</h2>
<p>I looooveee lists. <span class="caps">LOVE</span>. It surprised me that I haven’t been keeping a list of sprint retrospective items the past few months.  At the end of the sprint, I draw a blank for things we’ve done well and&nbsp;not-so-well.</p>
<p>This sprint, though, I kept a log. Stemming from my “Context Journal” (which is working <span class="caps">GREAT</span>, by the way), I decided to keep a page available in my notebook just for sprint&nbsp;notes.</p>
<p>It’s easy to keep a log of things that don’t go well. The hard part was recognizing things that went well (I think this is becauase when things go <em>really</em> well, they are actually invisible; we don’t know they go well because there wasn’t a problem standing out). But by keeping the sprint goals and overall project goals in mind, it helps to see positive trends and what causes&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Either way, keeping a log or a list and removing it from your mind helps retain focus for what needs attention now - and it also helps the review process&nbsp;later!</p>
