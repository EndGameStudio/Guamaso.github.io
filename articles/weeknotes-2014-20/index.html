<h2 id="catching-up">Catching&nbsp;Up</h2>
<p>Technically, this is <em>not</em> week 20, I am not interested in calculating what week it <em>really</em> is. We fail, we get back up and clear the dust, and we keep moving&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p>Life has continued to move in the past few months. I attended a CanJS meetup, I hope to be able to help out more often with the meetup.  I’m working on building something useful for my wife to help with her homeschooling. Work itself is proving to be fun, hard, and&nbsp;rewarding.</p>
<h2 id="being-mobile">Being&nbsp;mobile</h2>
<p>I have spent the past couple weeks with family in California. The biggest problem I’ve run into is not having ready access to wireless internet (Seriously, who doesn’t have Wi-fi anymore!?) I resolved this using my wireless hotspot which works great! Except I still like to watch things on Hulu and Netflix and sync my Dropbox and update the apps on my phone, etc. These activities have forced me to up our data&nbsp;limit.</p>
<p>Other than internet access, the only other problem is finding a quiet place to work. Coffee joints here aren’t too abundant and the kids can be, well, loud.  Next time I need to travel like this, I’ll probably scope out some coworking offices before hand.  It will probably be cheaper and less&nbsp;stressful.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the&nbsp;week</h2>
<p>I’m catching up on all my little web homes. This week’s goal is to simple update all my sites with one item. This could be an article or something&nbsp;simpler.</p>
