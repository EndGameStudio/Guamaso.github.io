<h2 id="managing-distractions">Managing&nbsp;Distractions</h2>
<p>I fail at managing distractions A <span class="caps">LOT</span>. When a fellow developer needs my help, I’ll help. Even though I probably should finish my current train of thought before I switch&nbsp;contexts.</p>
<p>I feel like that’s the trick though; switching contexts successfully. If you can switch context, finish the new task, than switch back seamlessly… you’re amazing.  Most of us, I imagine, can’t do&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Part of my problem is how I use my To Do list, Things.  I kind of wished there was a way to mark something as “current” or “in progress”, and only have the ability to mark one todo as such. It would also keep a memory of the order you worked on tasks. So, switching from task A to task B would be visible to you when you finished Task B and needed to return to task A.  It’s also not very easy to enter notes in Things. I love things and this is probably an edge case for many todo apps. This just means I need to have some sort of “context&nbsp;journal”.</p>
<p>I started that this week. I’ll report back on how it’s&nbsp;helping.</p>
