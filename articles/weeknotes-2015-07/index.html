<h2 id="canjs-scaffold">CanJS&nbsp;scaffold</h2>
<p>I spun up a project scaffold from scratch for the Code for Cary Art Finder Project.  There isn’t really a good scaffolder for CanJS, unfortunately. There are a <a href="https://github.com/smarkle/generator-can">couple</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-canjs">repos</a> out there with <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman generators</a> but they are a bit outdated in that they don’t work well with <a href="http://canjs.com/docs/can.Component.html"><code>can.Component</code></a>.  That is to say, they <em>work</em> they just don’t generate blank&nbsp;components.</p>
<p>Either way, I thought it would be a good idea to put into practice what I have learned on CanJS project structure.  I’m pretty happy with it and aim to post the project on Github&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>I would like to actually keep this structure clean and make <em>it</em> into a repo that I can use later. I’ve never created a Yeoman generator but I hear they’re super easy. Might take a stab at that as&nbsp;well.</p>
