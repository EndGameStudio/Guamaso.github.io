          <section class="content"><p>I suffer from “Oh shinny” disease. Symptoms include taking on too many new projects, tasks, or challenges.  There is no cure, but symptoms can be alleviated somewhat by sitting down and doing a mind&nbsp;dump.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I use mind dumps to get everything out onto something I can organize and prioritize.  In this case, in keeping with the purpose of the Dev Journal, I want to keep myself accountable for what I have taken on.  So, I’m also including a quick status update on the different projects I’ve started within the past couple&nbsp;months.</p>
<h2 id="wordpress-via-yeoman">WordPress via&nbsp;Yeoman</h2>
<p>I originally wanted to create a simple web app for an data import I am working on.  My first goal was to install WordPress using Yeoman. That worked great. The next goal was to be able to initiate a simple <span class="caps">PHP</span> web server for development using the install location as the web root.  This proved difficult due to my limited understanding of the built in PHP web server, MySQL server, and XAMPP.  I did eventually get that to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The last goal before actually being able to start working was to understand how to access data within the WordPress tables using nothing but the WordPress <span class="caps">API</span>’s (maybe some plugins, if needed). This is where work ceased on this project. I found that my time was better spent learning <a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember.js</a> and building an app that way.  Still, I would like to establish a good workflow using WordPress. Something that includes a <span class="caps">PHP</span> web server, MySQL server, and anything else one would need to work with&nbsp;WordPress.</p>
<p>I’ll look to <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> for this and report back… when I can.  This is low&nbsp;priority.</p>
<h2 id="gulp-and-publishing-via-wintersmith">Gulp and Publishing via&nbsp;Wintersmith</h2>
<p>I mentioned before why I’m not a fan of Grunt.  Things like <a href="https://github.com/substack/stream-handbook">“streams”</a> and “vinyl” files confuse me a bit but I still prefer Gulp over Grunt.  Maybe that is due to my&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>I worked a good deal on my script that helps publish articles with <a href="http://wintersmith.io/">Wintersmith</a>.  There are two items left on my To Do list, getting the spell check working and more awareness of what articles are <em>actually</em>&nbsp;published.  </p>
<p>This is still ongoing and it’s actually very rewarding. I was not aware of streams and it’s a good way to learn more about&nbsp;Node.js.</p>
<h2 id="code-for-cary-page">Code for Cary&nbsp;page</h2>
<p>I attended a meetup and offered my assistance with some of their front end problems. I thought the page was great as Robert, the creator of the page and co-captain of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Triangle-Code-for-America/">Code for Cary brigade</a>, said he learned how to implement a new script that used a slider affect when the user scrolls the page.  We always focus on whether a page (or product) is good based on the experience for the end user is.  This is a good measure but it’s not the only one.  Learning how to use something and when to apply it is a success. The end user may not like it which is a failure according to that first measure but even that is useful. Failures are only a failure if you don’t learn from&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I digress. I’m updating the page and really want to use <span class="caps">LESS</span> instead of straight CSS. I’m still working on this as well. This is actually number&nbsp;one.</p>
<h2 id="writing-moar-">Writing&nbsp;moar…</h2>
<p>I like writing. I love it. I suck at it, though.  I suck at web development, too, though.  And this journal’s purpose is to help me learn web development as much as it is to help me learn to write more better. (I did that on&nbsp;purpose…)</p>
<p>I write in a few different places which may contribute to the problem of not writing more often, I don’t feel like it’s a lot of places. I write about creativity in one spot, video games in another, and web dev here.  Not too bad.  My goal is one article a month for each site. With as many minor posts as possible. This, in case you were wondering, is a minor post.&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I really just need to shut up and write more. This is an ongoing thing,&nbsp;too.</p>
<h2 id="mentoring">Mentoring</h2>
<p>Like I said, I’m not that great. I don’t have my own agency, I haven’t organized my own conference, or made any major contributions to the community really.  I made peace with my inability to keep up with others skill-wise.  I know the saying, there is always someone smarter than you, but that’s not what this is about. I’m ok with not being an expert at anything.  That doesn’t mean stop learning or trying my best, it just means that I measure my success against myself. I know what I am capable of now and I know what success looks like to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>Success looks like helping others develop the skills.  I meet a lot of people just entering the field with that deer-in-headlights look. They want to know where to start and they’re scared because nothing makes sense.  Been there. I remember it clearly.  I remember thinking how much I would benefit from a mentor.  There are plenty of places to ask questions and get guidance on-line, but let’s be honest, we can be a bunch of jerks sometimes.  I’m getting rant-y so I’ll just finish by saying that we need a better mentoring system.  One that doesn’t require an initiate to have loads of cash (as much as those programs are worth the investment, not everyone has the time or finances to&nbsp;apply).</p>
<p>I’m doing research on how I can help.  Again, I’m not one of the “greats” by any means, but I got <em>heart</em>,&nbsp;yo.</p>

<p>I enjoy tinkering and learning and making. I also probably like to overthink things which is what you’ll mostly find here.</p>
