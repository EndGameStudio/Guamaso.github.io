<h2 id="audio-notes">Audio&nbsp;notes</h2>
<p>I bought a recorder a while back mostly for personal audio journaling but also for an amature podcast I do with a friend. It feels weird recording yourself, I’m not a scientist or a researcher or a coroner so I don’t really have a <em>need</em> for this kind of habit. That is, until I recorded my thoughts when I ran into a difficult programming&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>More often then not, there is someone on-line that I can bounce ideas off of at work. But sometimes there isn’t someone available or sometimes I’m not at my computer and I’m just idly thinking of the problem.  It was during one of these moments that I decided to speak my thoughts out&nbsp;loud.</p>
<p>There’s some real power with speaking out your thoughts. It might look a little nutty, but it’s extremely helpful. I’m not sure what this phenomenon is, but it seems like the brain processes the thoughts differently once their out of the realm of&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>Try it the next time your&nbsp;stuck.</p>
