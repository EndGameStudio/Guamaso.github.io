<h2 id="never-stop-learning">Never stop&nbsp;learning</h2>
<p>I was watching ‘3 Days to Kill’ the other night. I’m a huge Luc Besson fan, ever since Leon (more widely known as ‘The Professional’).  3 Days to Kill was ok, it was entertaining. It has <em>nothing</em> to do with web development but there was a moment in the film that gave me pause regarding the progression of experiences and wisdom in our&nbsp;lives.</p>
<p>There’s a scene where Kevin Costner’s character is feeling really bad for himself, sitting on a bridge in Paris, eating Chinese food by himself.  I thought, here’s this bad ass <span class="caps">CIA</span> guy who thought he had a solid grasp of his world. But in this moment, he knows&nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>What I like about this movie is that it goes against the cliche, “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks”.  Obviously, we get a happy ending for Kevin Costner after he learned to reassess what really was important in his life.  There is a more important message being displayed which is, family is the most important thing. But let’s focus on the Old-dog-learns-new-trick&nbsp;aspect.</p>
<p>In the technology world, the most important skill to have is learning. Apparently, this goes double for professional hit-men/<span class="caps">CIA</span>/secret agent dads.  But for people working with technology, there are moments where I get frustrated that I have to learn something new (it feels like very week these days). But once this new thing is learned and understood, I feel like He-man branding his sword high in the air; powerful and ready for the next&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<h2 id="canjs-and-firebase">CanJS and&nbsp;Firebase</h2>
<p>After building that quick CanJS page last week, I thought I’d take it a step further and build a <span class="caps">CMS</span> using Firebase as the backend.  I previously had trouble getting CanJS to talk with Firebase using <code>can.Model</code>. After a few weeks of working at Bitovi and facing the different CanJS challenges, as well as reviewing the CanJS documentation, I was able to figure out a&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>There aren’t any editing capabilities but the exciting part is it took me less than a day to build what I have so far. The next step is getting the live binding in CanJS to auto update the local Firebase&nbsp;data.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the&nbsp;week</h2>
<p>I wasn’t able to spend a lot of time with Document <span class="caps">JS</span>, pretty much only what I need for work.  I figured this will be an ongoing thing, learning Document JS as well as our other open source projects, specifically&nbsp;StealJS.</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect live binding to&nbsp;Firebase</li>
<li>Write article on experience with CanJS +&nbsp;Firebase.</li>
</ul>
