<h2 id="app-builds">App&nbsp;builds</h2>
<p>As an application grows, especially in its infancy, there needs to be some processes in place to help achieve and maintain goals for the build&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>We recently split off all our web components into their own repo and this caused all kinds of madness. It was something we couldn’t foresee and, therefore, it wasn’t something we could have done&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Still, when something we built ends up being a blocker for current work, there needs to be some sort of <a href="/articles/Meetup-talk-aar/"><span class="caps">AAR</span></a> where we figure out what went wrong and how to avoid it in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>We don’t have a dev ops person… well, not explicitly anyway. I wouldn’t say we <em>should</em> have one, but we should remove someone from a sprint when something huge happens, something like changing our repos this extensively. This person’s sole responsibility is to monitor and maintain the build. They should document and test the build until it satisfactory. A lot of people will have a problem with this because the velocity of the next sprint will be negatively affected. It’s a tough situation. I’m curious how similar size teams handle this&nbsp;situation.</p>
<h2 id="commonjs">CommonJS</h2>
<p>I had to familiarize myself with how CommonJS works a bit this week. I don’t mean the <code>require</code> or <code>exports</code> keywords but more how it looks for files and which <em>thing</em> to use when there could be multiples. Maybe I’m not looking right but I couldn’t seem to find much on this type of&nbsp;information.</p>
