<h2 id="logging-time">Logging&nbsp;time</h2>
<p>I wonder who really benefits from logging time. There are rarely tools that make it easy to capture time spent on projects, render time reports, <em>and</em> add on other business specific options.  Never mind being cost&nbsp;effective.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time logging time and I was wondering how often time tracking is actually useful beyond the time spent tracking the actual time spent. More often I hear legal reasons than billing reasons and almost rarely hear productivity&nbsp;reasons.</p>
<p>Just&nbsp;sayin’.</p>
<h2 id="firebase-s-firepad">Firebase’s&nbsp;Firepad</h2>
<p>I built a quick app using <a href="https://www.firebase.com/">Firebase’s</a> <a href="http://www.firepad.io/">Firepad tool</a>. Firepad is a notepad with versioning (ish) and collaboration while using Firebase as the backend.  It’s pretty neat to have all that functionality baked in and not have to think about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t lend well to module loaders. This is fine but I want to make builds of it so I can use it in different places and only need to change a few options for each&nbsp;build.</p>
<p>I found myself working on separating each of it’s internal tools into files so I can require them into the main file.  This is great as I am learning a lot about module loaders and, specifically,&nbsp;StealJS.</p>
