<p>Establishing a <span class="caps">LESS</span> workflow using Gulp. Found out about Code for America - a really cool&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p><span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Part of leveling up my skills is also leveling up my ability to communicate, lead, and mentor others. I feel that these skills require constant interaction with fellow developers.  Therefore, I attend a lot of meetups… well, as many as I&nbsp;can.</p>
<p><a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> is a really great organization. Having developed an interest in local government while working for the City of Fayetteville a few years back, I thought it would be interesting to see what the organization had to offer.  There are three Brigades (groups or teams), in the Raleigh/Durham area: Raleigh, Durham, and Cary. It so happened that I was free the night of the Cary meetup.  Meeting with the team of civic-minded folks was great and&nbsp;inspiring.</p>
<p>They mentioned needing help with the landing page of the Code for Cary site. I started working on that earlier and thought it would be a great place to learn <span class="caps">LESS</span>. Unfortunately, I am a perfectionist.  Through my initial research, I found that using LESS in development requires adding scripts so the files are compiled by the client. This is fine - actually, this is perfect. The problem is, I don’t know what the production environment is like. Which means that I’ll have to compile a build and have that ready for production. That is just too much for a simple page&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I’m going to keep researching and learning but I may skip <span class="caps">LESS</span> on this project. Who knows, maybe it won’t be so bad and I use it&nbsp;anyway.</p>
