<h2 id="the-cary-updates">The Cary&nbsp;Updates</h2>
<p>You can see the main updates on the <a href="http://www.codeforcary.org/projects/the_cary/updates/2">Code for Cary</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>I like the idea of abstracting the scraper tool from the scraping steps.  The page we scrape can change over time and may not lend itself to being scraped easily. Also, we might need to scrape other pages to verify our data.  For these reasons I want to build a tool that can read a configuration file, process it into commands, then do the actual scrape. The file will also tell the tool how to build the data it&nbsp;scrapes.  </p>
<p>I need to work out the structure of the config file so I know what needs to be built but I’m thinking of starting small and just trying to make something basic. Then, as I continue with The Cary, I can refactor as&nbsp;needed.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the&nbsp;week</h2>
<p>I’m in training in Chicago all week so just focusing on absorbing as much as&nbsp;possible.</p>
