<h2 id="scope-creep">Scope&nbsp;Creep</h2>
<p>I export my tasks from Jira and other work task management tools into Things. It’s easier because I can break up tasks into sizes that work better for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I noticed this past sprint that I added a single task to my workload. When I broke it out into individual tasks, it turned into three tasks. I then added documentation and test updates, which made it five&nbsp;tasks. </p>
<p>After working on the first task, I had questions on changes which resulted in two more tasks.  These new tasks, after the final product was reviewed, resulted in a five more tasks. Keep in mind these are all minimal tasks. One could be something like “change color for text” while another could be something more involved but still as small as it could be. Something like “resolve merge&nbsp;conflicts”. </p>
<p>This is really normal and I’m glad I aggregate my lists this way, specifically because it helps me respond to scope changes like&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>It’s also interesting to see a task list turn into a hydra monster. One task turned into three which turned into five, which turned into seven, which is still not done and could continue&nbsp;growing.</p>
<p>Keeping track of these monsters is important, at some point (if it continues to grow), the wheel needs to get&nbsp;squeaky.</p>
