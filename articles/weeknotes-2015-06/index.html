<h2 id="phantomjs">PhantomJS</h2>
<p>I have to research this more, but as I struggle with writing tests for my code, I have this recurring thought: why do we test code in a browser environment that really isn’t an end-user browser?  If it’s a module loader issue, fine. But I suspect it isn’t. Integration tests should be run on the different browsers the project has identified as key&nbsp;browsers.</p>
<p>I could just be complaining or missing something important. I’m skeptical, though. More research is&nbsp;required.</p>
<h2 id="code-for-cary">Code for&nbsp;Cary</h2>
<p>This past Tuesday (the 10<span class="ord">th</span>), Code for Cary met to listen to a request from the Arts Center folks. They essentially want to wrap their artwork database with a useful interface for citizens.  There’s a few different projects by other Brigades doing essentially the same thing but none of them are at the level Cary&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>I’m still going over my notes about the project but I’m really excited to see what we can build for them. Cary, and many many other cities, have beautiful artwork that citizens can enjoy - if only they knew about them or how to find&nbsp;them.</p>
