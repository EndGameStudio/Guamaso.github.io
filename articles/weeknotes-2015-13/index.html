<h2 id="bitovi-retreat">Bitovi&nbsp;Retreat</h2>
<p>This was my first retreat with the team and it was <span class="caps">AMAZING</span>. The first part of the week was basically a hackathon where we tried to work on stuff that we had proposed back in December. Most being tools to improve our Open Source&nbsp;products.</p>
<p>The project I worked on was building a component library for CanJS.  Other teams worked on improving DocumentJS, CanJS, and more.  The component library ended up using many of the improvements to help present the work in a useful way. DocumentJS, for example, was great for creating the <span class="caps">API</span> docs that included demos of each&nbsp;component.  </p>
<p>After the work week, significant others were flown out for the weekend where we explored and enjoyed Austin&nbsp;Texas.</p>
<p>It was an amazing experience. There were long days but I can’t imagine a better group of people to spend loooong days with while getting some very cool stuff&nbsp;built.</p>
