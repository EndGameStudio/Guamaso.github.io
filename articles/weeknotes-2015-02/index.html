<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>I’ve been out of town this week for a client and I noticed a few things on this trip that I hadn’t noticed before on previous trips. Specifically to do with the flight itself.  I heard about “man-spreading” on trains the other day. I was a little perturbed at how this isn’t a rule on planes, too. Ugh. </soapbox></p>
<p>I have a standing desk at home and it feels great to stand all day. When I’m traveling, I’ve noticed that I spend a lot more time sitting because most places default to sitting environments - and rightly so, this is how most people work. Still, I am wondering if it’s possible to take a small portable standing desk with me next time. And if so, I wonder if it’s possible to not look like a weirdo when you bust out your folding standing&nbsp;desk.</p>
<p>I’ve started creating a wish list in Amazon that contain things that I’ve found are great for traveling. A portable surge protector with built in <span class="caps">USB</span> ports, for example. We’ll see how it evolves as I continue to&nbsp;travel.</p>
