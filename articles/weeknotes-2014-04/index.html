<p>Traveled this week which means two things. Got nothing done and learned that I can get a lot of nothing done with an iPad.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>Being nomadic is an interesting concept for a distributed workforce.  I work from home and don’t venture out to coffee shops or other remote areas so traveling while still meeting other obligations is an interesting challenge.  Unfortunately, the obligations I’m talking about are work related; I wasn’t able to work on my own leveling&nbsp;up.</p>
<p>I was able to use this whole experience as an experiment on working nomadically.  First of all, my work laptop failed miserably - the wireless card is crap on this laptop.  Thanks to <span class="caps">GIT</span>, I was able to do work, do some minor testing (our app requires access to a remote database), and commit locally.  However, I wasn’t able to push my commits to&nbsp;Github.</p>
<p>For our standups I used Zoom on the iPad.  In fact, the iPad turned out to work out very well for writing code and other tasks like writing documentation or updating Jira.  After a few hours of fiddling with the laptop, I gave up and switched to using the iPad completely.  My work is backed up to Dropbox but since only the iPad could access the web, the little work I churned out via the laptop was not backed up right&nbsp;away. </p>
<p>Although there doesn’t seem to be a native/easy way to commit or push from the iPad, I could have used my work desktop via Citrix.  I don’t like the idea of relying on a remote machine.  There are many possible failure points: the computer itself, the network it’s on, the Citrix server, and everything in between.  This is really the only chink in the armor but it’s a chink that is hard to hit (this metaphor isn’t working for&nbsp;me…). </p>
<p>I was thinking of doing some <span class="caps">SASS</span>/LESS work in Wakanda this week.  One task requires me to do some CSS work and thought it would be a good time to bring in the last piece of the puzzle. I am using Gulp to compile CoffeeScript, so using LESS was next on my “To Do” list anyway. Should be&nbsp;fun.</p>
