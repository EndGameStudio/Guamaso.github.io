<h2 id="metalsmith">Metalsmith</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> is a JavaScript static site generator. The site also says it can scaffold and automate processes. It’s very similar to Gulp in that it uses pipes (called <code>use</code> in Metalsmith) and, obviously, it uses streams. Metalsmith can indeed be used to scaffold applications but I don’t know why anyone would use that in client work with more heavy communities like Gulp and&nbsp;Grunt.</p>
<p>Still, I tried using Gulp to build a static site and found it somewhat cumbersome and difficult.  Metalsmith seems to handle this task effortlessly.  I’m using it now to build a really simple photoblog site and I find it more flexible than Wintersmith as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Wintersmith’s biggest downfall, with me at least, was it’s inability to handle drafts. A plugin would have to be written in order to handle it. Metalsmith is the same. The difference, though, is that writing a plugin for Metalsmith is sooo much easier. That and there’s already a plugin to handle drafts!&nbsp;;)</p>
<p>I’ve run into a few problems with Metalsmith because of the way I want to do things, and all I have to do is write a plugin for it. I wanted to change the date format and couldn’t find an easy plugin for that, so I wrote a quick plugin that copies and formats the date. It’s not a very good, reusable plugin, but it does the job for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>The only weird issue I’ve run into that doesn’t rub me right is pagination of posts. I don’t want to use Handlebars and I’m trying to figure out how to paginate without switching my templating&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>Also, the pagination and custom link plugins are very order dependent. But, that kinda makes sense, I&nbsp;think.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the&nbsp;week</h2>
<p>I am using Things to manage my Todo lists. I added all my little sites as tags and created a Website project. I am populating it with all the updates I want to make to my sites.  This week, I would like to start whittling the list&nbsp;down.</p>
