<h2 id="keeping-lists-organized">Keeping lists&nbsp;organized</h2>
<p>I’ve been using Things a lot in the past few months.  I’ve tried so many To Do apps and methods. I’ll admit that I never dove in the deep end of Getting Things Done. I thought <span class="caps">GTD</span> was just too “bossy” for me. I really liked Todo.txt because of its simplicity.  I tried plain pencil and paper but it got too&nbsp;cluttered.</p>
<p>After downloading Things, though, I researched <span class="caps">GTD</span> more and realized how powerful and simple it really is. Coupled with Things itself, which is very clean and well built, I’ve never had To Do’s so managed and within reach.  To Do lists are different for everyone and there’s so much talk out there about how to manage lists that I won’t go into&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about being forced to have multiple lists on different mediums. For example, a client has the project’s tasks in Jira. I have my personal stuff in Things.  My wife puts the shopping list in FetchNotes. I fight the urge to just make everyone use Things. Not that it would do me any good since you can’t really share items in&nbsp;Things…</p>
<p>I found that the “inboxing” time is important with keeping this madness under control. I go through my different lists and add what needs&nbsp;adding.</p>
<p>It’s pretty simple and fairly effective. There’s issues with “on-the-fly” situations like shopping lists but I adjust based on the situation. The point is, though, that these situations are&nbsp;minimized.</p>
