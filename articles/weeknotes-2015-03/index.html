<h2 id="agile-thoughts">Agile&nbsp;thoughts</h2>
<p>I like any method that revolves itself around iteration and self analyzation. Agile is great with these concepts. On the other hand, it doesn’t cease to frustrate how often people try to figure out problems other’s have experienced and solved. I know that every team is different and every project is different, but I don’t agree that teams should spend time figuring out a solved problem as if the problem wasn’t solved already.  I guess what I’m saying is I think teams should recognize there is a problem, which teams seem to do well, and table it until someone (if not everyone on the team) can research the problem some more. Then come back and hash it&nbsp;out.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the&nbsp;week</h2>
<p>I suck at git rebase. I don’t understand it, I don’t know what use cases it’s for, etc. I will become more familiar with it this&nbsp;week.</p>
