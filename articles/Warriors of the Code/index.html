<blockquote>
<p>We are the Warriors of the Code. We are dedicated, strong, merry, and in search of glory. Often we find ourselves engaged in such glorious battles. It is in these battles that warriors fall, advances hard fought, and the days long and tiring.  But we are destroyers and carpenters! We hunger for challenges. We thirst for knowledge! Victory and glory is assured for those that follow the elite, the Warriors of the&nbsp;Code!</p>

<p>Today is the 28<span class="ord">th</span> of July. I fear how difficult this will be to write just before the day my friend passed away, but I need to write this; it needs to be a&nbsp;thing. </p>
<p>It’s ironic that I write this in Sublime - he defended it’s strengths to me. The lighting is dark in my room except for a white light above my desk, the perfect amount of light for working at night, really. All things on my desk perfectly visible, notes scribbled on index cards, scattered across my desk; this morning’s empty mug of coffee; and a notebook opened to a page with the words “Warrior of the&nbsp;Code”.</p>
<p>Years ago, he would leave his desk for a meeting or go grab something to eat or go speak with one of our analysts. Every time, he left his computer unlocked. Little horns would slowly peek out from the crown of my head as I snuck over to his cubicle. The actions of my trademark prank were down to a muscle reflex - I would activate the impaired vision theme in Windows and lower the resolution of his monitors, then run like hell.  Upon his return, I struggled to keep a straight face, sometimes I gave myself away and we would laugh. Other times he would wake his computer and we would&nbsp;laugh.</p>
<p>Those were <strong>good times.</strong> He was such a good sport about it all. The conversations we would have on best practices, relationships, race, life… the future. Always that grin on his face and always a baseball cap covering his dome. <em>Always</em>.</p>
<p>His viewing was surreal. My mind battled the truth that my senses explained. That person lying there? He wasn’t smiling but it <em>was</em> him. I knew that he was gone and so were the smiles. So were all the thoughtful and frank&nbsp;discussions. </p>
<p>There lay my friend’s empty&nbsp;shell. </p>
<p>A Warrior of the Code, though, for all&nbsp;eternity.</p>
<p>The quote in the beginning was written a year ago.  The Warriors of the Code was created the week after he died, if only in my&nbsp;heart.</p>
<p>Part of me fears the status of his everlasting soul. Part of me is angry - he had no right to take away his potential from the world he was born into. Part of me is content knowing that I was his friend, even for just a sample of the time he lived.  Every part of me, though, believes that he lived with such passion and&nbsp;direction.</p>
<p>He loved his music. He loved the web.  Both things he did with all of his energy.  One of our last deep conversations he said something that has never left&nbsp;me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“… You can go where the legacy is and be part of something great or you can stay where you are, create your own legacy <em>now</em> and <em>make</em> something&nbsp;great.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I argued with him. Sometimes you <em>have</em> to move on. Sometimes you <em>need</em> something new. We agreed on one thing though, it is up to you to create your own legacy, to make something&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>The day he was buried, I promised myself to live what I always knew was right.  I would create my own legacy and I would make something great. For me first, but in part for my friend as&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Two years ago today, my friend made his final choice - he left us what he could and took the rest with him.  But what he left the people around him isn’t worthless or frivolous; he left us the best part of himself.  That smile of his, that energy - his spirit!  It’s that spirit that I fall back to on difficult&nbsp;days.</p>
<p>Daniel Walker was a good man. I called him my friend. I miss him. You should,&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>Depression, mental health, and suicide are important subjects. One that I feel our country does not take seriously at all.  Please make yourself aware of <a href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">warning signs</a>. If you are considering suicide, please call&nbsp;1-800-273-8255. </p>
