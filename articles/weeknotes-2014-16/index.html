<p>Change is sometimes difficult, but always enriching.  This first week at Bitovi has been amazing. My brain hurts… but in a good way. I consider myself a pretty smart fellow; I don’t have a ton of experience but I learn quickly… <em>very</em>&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>This week, though, challenged my ability to learn. The last time I felt this challenged was when I took my first web application development position. It’s so different and complex that it took me a while to get caught up.  On the one hand, I have this level of challenging work and very experienced peers.  On the other hand, I have this gratifying feeling of learning new things and becoming a better engineer.  And just like before, it will take me some time to get caught up, but when I do, it will be&nbsp;glorious.</p>
<p>Change can be so difficult that it can cause feelings of insecurity and fear.  This, in turn, increases the risk of failure.  Now imagine a place that understands this dynamic and does everything it can to make sure that people feel welcome and free to express their difficulties.  That’s Bitovi, a place with&nbsp;Bitovians.</p>
<p>Yes, change can be and usually is hard but when you’re surrounded by good people that care and want each other to succeed, the only way to fail is to stop&nbsp;trying.</p>
<p>It’s great to be a&nbsp;Bitovian.</p>
