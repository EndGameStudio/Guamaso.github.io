<h2 id="working-outside">Working&nbsp;outside</h2>
<p>We had our first nice-ish day this year. It was nice enough to leave the windows open all day and even sit on the porch and do some work. There are days where I miss the immediate interaction one can get when working at an office. Collaboration works so much cleaner, I think, in this&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Remote work isn’t worse, it’s just different. This collaboration still exists, just over a wire. I don’t think it takes a “specific type of person” to be a remote worker, but it definitely requires a certain mindset. The rewards for being able to work this way are bountiful. One such benefit is working on your porch.&nbsp;;)</p>
