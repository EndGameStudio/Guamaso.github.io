<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>I remember getting in trouble with my parents as a young teenager for what boiled down to not communicating.  I don’t remember exactly what happened but it was something like I didn’t mention something important that needed to get done. Communicating issues is sooo important when working on a project with a life span. <span class="caps">SOOOO</span>&nbsp;important.</p>
<p>I think sometimes we get afraid to disappoint people either by admitting we can’t keep a promise or by not having a skill we probably should have. Either way, we absorb these concerns and, as a friend explained to me, we tell ourselves that we can make up the difference; we can catch up and deliver the&nbsp;deliverables.</p>
<p>Whether or not the culture primes this attitude or not, we should feel bad to be honest. Sometimes miscommunication stems from a misunderstanding, which we still shouldn’t feel bad about. Either way, I learned that when it comes to building applications (or really anything), mistakes are only failures if don’t learn from them. This is something I already believe but never applied it to professional relationships. Which brings me to my next&nbsp;thought…</p>
<h2 id="being-ok">Being&nbsp;Ok</h2>
<p>I have this annoying ability to feel <em>really</em> bad when I fail my team mates, friends, and family.  I mean <em>really</em> bad.  Part of recovering from a mistake is moving beyond the mistake. To do this, we have to be <span class="caps">OK</span> with ourselves first. Being OK with the part of us that made the mistake is part of learning process. Being OK with ourselves is part of accepting the mistake and understanding why it&nbsp;happened.</p>
