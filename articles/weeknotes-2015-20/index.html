<p>I had a day off this week. A <em>real</em> day off. Minor traveling involved… because it’s not a day off if you have chores or family trips. Although we did go on a family trip, we spent most of the time at the beach, about a few hours away. I got to play in the water with the kids, help them build <em>really crappy</em> sand sculptures, and finished it off with a quick drive around the <span class="caps">USS</span> North Carolina (I’m a fan of war&nbsp;machines).</p>
<p>This kind of down time is few and far in between for me. The past month has been so hectic and busy and stressful, that this actually helped… A <span class="caps">LOT</span>. In fact, it reminded me what life <em>should</em>&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>I love what I do. But the moment it starts to creep up on you and pull the wool over your eyes, you’re in danger. You can love what you do and then get soooo involved in that thing you love that you don’t realize that you really don’t love it anymore. You think you do but you don’t. It’s taken over your life and it reminds you that you love it and it trys sooooo hard to keep you near it. It know that as soon as you have time to take a breath, you’ll realize you don’t love it anymore and&nbsp;leave.</p>
<p>I’m not there. Not yet. But I did realize a lot this week about my pace. I knew I was overdoing it a few weeks ago. But my day off has given me measurable&nbsp;proof.</p>
