<h2 id="changing-routines">Changing&nbsp;routines</h2>
<p>I liked finishing my weeks with weeknotes. I noticed that I started Monday with little context and wondered if weeknotes could help with&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>I’d like to be able to start my week with some goals that come from these. I normally have a small list of goals for the week but that usually includes house to-do’s and work to-do’s, not skill-leveling-up to-do’s.  So, I thought I’d try switching my week notes to Mondays&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p>The problem with changing your routine, though, is that it breaks your routine!  Monday morning I was struggling with trying to remember something I had to do that day. I didn’t remember what it was until late that night.  That alone is a great learning experience: try not to change your routine, if you really have to, set yourself up for success by creating reminders or something similar that will help you transition and rebuild that&nbsp;routine.</p>
<h2 id="learning-canjs">Learning&nbsp;<span class="caps">CANJS</span></h2>
<p>My first two weeks at <a href="http://bitovi.com/">Bitovi</a> have been two weeks of non-stop learning. It’s been&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>Last week, I decided that I had enough confidence to try something simple with <a href="http://canjs.com/">CanJS</a>. So, I created a very simple display of data using components.  I am going to clean out some of my personal data from it and make the code a bit more generic. Once that’s done, I’ll push the repo and write up a post of what I did. It’s nothing profound but it helped me review what I’ve learned and cement a lot of the&nbsp;concepts.</p>
<h2 id="goals-for-the-week">Goals for the&nbsp;week</h2>
<ul>
<li>Push update to my CanJS practice&nbsp;app</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="http://www.javascriptmvc.com/docs/DocumentJS.html">DocumentJS</a>, our open source JavaScript project documentation&nbsp;builder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Documentation is a pet-peeve of mine. Its a great opportunity to contribute to a project that can help other’s build helpful documentation for their&nbsp;projects.</p>
