<h2 id="created-wakanda-data-import-tool">Created Wakanda data import&nbsp;tool</h2>
<p>I couldn’t find a way to easily import data from one server to another that was required by parts of the application. <a href="/Wakanda-Import-Concept/">I created a datastore class method</a> the read a <span class="caps">JSON</span> file and import any missing records.  It’s a great first step for our team if we decide to continue using Wakanda local datastores (versus remote datastores).  I think that these local datastores are great, faster, less cumbersome, and more powerful. But that’s not my call.&nbsp;:(</p>
<h2 id="started-gulp-grunt-talk">Started Gulp/Grunt&nbsp;talk</h2>
<p>Finished my outline and now in the process of adding more and more detail. Still nothing to link to yet which is good. I feel that it’s not a <em>thing</em> until there is a link which keeps my nerves in&nbsp;check.</p>
<h2 id="set-up-ember-environment-with-yeoman">Set up Ember environment with&nbsp;Yeoman</h2>
<p>I freak out at the shear amount of <em>stuff</em> Yeoman loads in a folder after it is done running a generator. The Grunt file alone is insane. Once I looked through it, though, it made sense. The same goes for the rest of the objects in the project folder. Anyway, I loaded up an Ember generator to use EmberFire on it.  Get to fiddle with that tonight&nbsp;actually.</p>
