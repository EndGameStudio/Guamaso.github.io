          <section class="content"><p>I like command line but as a consumer of some products, I prefer a <span class="caps">GUI</span>. Automated tasks runners like Grunt and Gulp, in my opinion should have a GUI for consumers (read: developers). I’ve seen some early work and attempts but nothing very usable. So, here I am learning one of them because, through all my complaining, I <em>do</em> need to learn them.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>I like learning a new thing by implementing it in something I am already working on.  I figured automating some of my dev journal workflow made sense. Since Wintersmith doesn’t really <em>do</em> drafts, I figured Gulp could help out a bit.  So, I worked out the tasks that I <em>think</em> I need in order to make publish easier via Github Pages and&nbsp;Wintersmith.  </p>
<p>Not all the steps are required right now, like testing each published article for example.  In fact, some of these steps I’d like to wrap as a plugin. But that’s for&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>I started out with the following file&nbsp;structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>dev_journal - root<ul>
<li>articles - holds markdown articles<ul>
<li>drafts</li>
<li>scheduled</li>
<li>published</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>github_pages -&nbsp;“production”</li>
<li>wintersmith - holds published articles and template<ul>
<li>build</li>
<li>template</li>
<li>content</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three git repos, one for the root <code>articles</code> folder, one for the <code>wintersmith\template</code> folder, and one for the <code>github_pages</code> folder.  I could probably consolidate these down to two, maybe even one repo but I’m doing this in baby steps. :)  All of the gulp and package files live in&nbsp;root.</p>
<p>The tasks are written out with every step I <strong>want</strong> in my workflow. But I don’t have the time to learn and get all of it working so I’m focusing on the moving of files first. I will fine tune and improve as I go&nbsp;along.</p>
<h2 id="gulp-task-process-drafts">Gulp Task: Process&nbsp;Drafts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grab all files from <code>articles/drafts</code></li>
<li>Check spelling and grammar.  Do not continue processing file if errors exist but save a copy of it to <code>articles/drafts</code> with spelling/grammar&nbsp;suggestions.</li>
<li>Check metadata of file. Wintersmith has the metadata header which has a few required fields. Do not continue processing file if errors&nbsp;exist.</li>
<li>Move remaining files to <code>articles/scheduled</code> folder.  If the header is filled out then it’s ready to be&nbsp;published.</li>
<li>Commit changes to the <code>articles</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gulp-task-process-scheduled-articles">Gulp Task: Process Scheduled&nbsp;Articles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Grab all files from <code>artciles/scheduled</code></li>
<li>Spellcheck each file.  Create a copy of any file with errors. Move original and copy to <code>articles/drafts</code> folder.</li>
<li>Create folders in <code>wintersmith/content/articles</code> based on file names of each markdown&nbsp;file.</li>
<li>Copy each file into its respective&nbsp;folder.</li>
<li>Rename each file to&nbsp;“index.md”</li>
<li>Run wintersmith build, verify no&nbsp;errors.</li>
<li>Commit changes to the <code>articles</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gulp-task-publish-to-github-pages">Gulp Task: Publish to Github&nbsp;Pages</h2>
<ul>
<li>Clear github pages folder (except&nbsp;.git)</li>
<li>Copy wintersmith/build folder to github pages&nbsp;folder. </li>
<li>Commit changes to <code>github_pages</code> repo.</li>
<li>Push changes to&nbsp;GitHub.</li>
<li>Wait a few moments (for github pages to update). Maybe this can be a separate&nbsp;task?</li>
<li>Check each article to make sure it exists at url and that content is&nbsp;correct.</li>
<li>Move scheduled files to the published folder, if they were indeed&nbsp;published.</li>
</ul>

<p>I enjoy tinkering and learning and making. I also probably like to overthink things which is what you’ll mostly find here.</p>
