<p>Week notes are a great cross between journaling and blogging. The goal of keeping yourself accountable to the interwebz and, more importantly, yourself, is a good goal to shoot for.
<span class="more"></span></p>
<p>There is a lot to learn in the world of web development; always something new coming out.  I have a Trello board listing all the applications, frameworks, languages, and tools that I need to, at the very least, become familiar&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>This week I focused on getting caught up with some other articles/posts as well as keeping up with work tasks. Not a whole lot of time spent on learning new things or practicing existing skills (outside of work,&nbsp;anyway).  </p>
<p>We are switching over to Wakanda at work and I’m looking to see how I can use things like Grunt/Gulp, <span class="caps">SASS</span>, or CoffeeScript with it.  The application is fairly robust and flexible… ish.  I was able to get Foundation working with it some time ago, as well as Mustache.  I even used CoffeeScript for a module script I had to write.  I’m just not sure how to fit in these tools seamlessly with the built in server. It will probably require a custom&nbsp;plugin.</p>
