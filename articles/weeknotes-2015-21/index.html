<h2 id="implicit-isn-t-as-strong-as-explicit">Implicit isn’t as strong as&nbsp;explicit</h2>
<p>I love working at Bitovi. There is this amazing freedom of being able to rely on each other. I know when I ask someone to do something, it will get done.  That hasn’t always been the case in my&nbsp;career. </p>
<p>Not all people we work with are the same, though. Some people require more direct management. I’ve found, especially this week, that people more often need explicit instructions instead of implicit instructions.  If I assign a task to someone I trust, I don’t have to really go through every detail, it is implicit that they will find the information and ask questions when&nbsp;needed.</p>
<p>Others need more explicit instruction and, let’s call it what it is, hand holding. Where this is more work for me, I’m <span class="caps">OK</span> with it. As long we understand that the real goal is to make this person more independent. We should be as autonomous as possible. When given a task, we should be able to bring it to completion without constant supervision (assuming the task is realistic, of&nbsp;course).</p>
